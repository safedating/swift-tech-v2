            The story of Swift Tech began with a bad experience that I had with
            one of the identity verification service providers. In 2012, I was
            working as a developer of a financial institution. I was to
            integrate a famous KYC solution of that time as part of a major
            digitization project of a financial institute. After multiple
            failures and delays, the solution was implemented but we ended up
            cancelling the whole project and reverted to manual KYC. All because
            the codes of that KYC solution were inadequate and its tech staff
            was unable to provide us with sufficient support.
          </p>

          <p class="promote">
            Established on the principles of authenticity, trust, and
            transparency, Swift Tech became the first company to offer free
            trials in the identity verification industry and kept its pricing
            public.

              So how can you verify someone? If they already have a Swift Tech
              ID, just ask for their unique QR code, and scan it. However, if
              they do not have an ID and you still choose to meet with them,
              Swift Tech takes no responsibility for any resulting risk or harm.
